Process in system programming
// Process is a program in execution, which includes the program code and its current activity.
    A process has its own memory space and system resources.

 // Single vs Concurrent vs Parallel Programming
 Single programming
 ********************
 // Single programming means only one process is in execution at a time.

Concurrent programming
************************
 // Concurrent programming means more than one process is in execution at the same time, but only one of them might be making progress.
 // Concurrent programming requires time-bound CPU scheduling

Parallel programming
*********************
 // Parallel programming means more than one process is in execution as well as making progress at the same time.
 // Parallel programming requires multiple program counters
