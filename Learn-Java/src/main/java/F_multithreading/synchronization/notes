Synchronization Notes:

Problem Situation:
1. Critical sections in multi-threaded applications can lead to
2.  Race conditions, deadlocks, and inconsistent data if not managed properly.
3. Pre-emptive in thread scheduling can cause threads to be interrupted at any time (because of context switching),

Solution to handle synchronization:
1. Removing Race Conditions:
   - Use locks (mutexes) to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.
   - Use atomic variables for simple operations that need to be thread-safe without locks.
2. Synchronized blocks and methods:
   - Use synchronized blocks to ensure that only one thread can execute a block of code at a time.
   - Use synchronized methods to ensure that only one thread can execute a method at a time.

Scenarios:
// 1. Two threads incrementing a shared counter.
// 2. A thread waiting for a condition to be met before proceeding.
// 3. A thread releasing a lock after completing its task.
// 4. A thread acquiring a lock before accessing a shared resource.
// 5. A thread signaling another thread to wake up after a condition changes.
// 6. A thread using a semaphore to limit access to a resource.
// 7. A thread using a read-write lock to allow multiple readers or a single writer.
// 8. A thread using a barrier to synchronize multiple threads at a certain point.
// 9. A thread using a countdown latch to wait for multiple threads to complete before proceeding.
// 10. A thread using a future to get the result of an asynchronous computation.
// 11. A thread using a thread pool to manage multiple threads efficiently.
// 12. A thread using a lock to ensure mutual exclusion when accessing a shared resource.
// 13. A thread using a condition variable to wait for a specific condition to be met.
// 14. A thread using a mutex to protect shared data from concurrent access.
// 15. A thread using a spinlock to repeatedly check for a condition before proceeding.
// 16. A thread using a reentrant lock to allow a thread to acquire the same lock multiple times.
// 17. A thread using a read lock to allow multiple threads to read a shared resource concurrently.
// 18. A thread using a write lock to ensure exclusive access to a shared resource for writing.
// 19. A thread using a fair lock to ensure that threads acquire the lock in the order they requested it.
// 20. A thread using a non-fair lock to allow threads to acquire the lock without strict ordering.
// 21. A thread using a condition to signal other threads when a resource becomes available.
// 22. A thread using a lock to protect a critical section of code from concurrent access.
// 23. A thread using a synchronized block to ensure that only one thread can execute a block of code at a time.
// 24. A thread using a synchronized method to ensure that only one thread can execute a method at a time.
// 25. A thread using a volatile variable to ensure visibility of changes across threads.
// 26. A thread using an atomic variable to perform lock-free operations on shared data.
// 27. A thread using a thread-safe collection to manage shared data without explicit locking.
// 28. A thread using a concurrent queue to allow multiple threads to add and remove elements safely.
// 29. A thread using a concurrent map to allow multiple threads to access and modify key-value pairs safely.
// 30. A thread using a concurrent set to allow multiple threads to add and remove elements safely.
