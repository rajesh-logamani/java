Access modifiers/AccessSpecifiers.java
******************
In Java (and many other object-oriented languages),
access modifiers and access specifiers control the visibility or access level of classes, methods, and variables.

// There are four access specifiers in Java:
// 1. public: The member is accessible from any other class.
// 2. protected: The member is accessible within its own package and by subclasses.
// 3. default (no modifier): The member is accessible only within its own package.
// 4. private: The member is accessible only within its own class.
