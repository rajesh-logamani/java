Thread Safety:
ArrayList, Linked List => Non Thread Safety
Vector => Thread Safety (But it became legacy, because of performance)
Stack => Same as Vector (We can use ArrayList, Linked List instead which gives you almost everything)


Diff between ArrayList and Vector (Only diff is thread safety)






Maps:
    1. HashMap (No order) - O[1]

    2. TreeMap (Sorted order) - O[long N]

    3. LinkedHashMap (More Insertion & Deletion) - O[1]
