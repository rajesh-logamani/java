Inheritance.java
****************
Java does not support multiple inheritance, so if a class is declared, since Java does not know which class to inherit from.
// If a class is declared as final, it cannot be extended by any other class.


Data members
***************
Interface members are implicitly public, static, and final. because they are constants.
